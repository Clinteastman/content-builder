        <p class="pt-4">
          Our artificial flowers stay beautiful for 5-10 years with minimal
          care. A quick dust now and then keeps them fresh, and placing them
          away from direct sun helps maintain their colours. When you consider
          how many fresh bouquets that replaces, they make smart financial
          sense.
